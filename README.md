cooking-units
=============

Overview
--------

While writing a cookery book, units and their format can be quite
troublesome. This contains not only the question of how to print those
units, but also the question of the conversion of units. A cookery
book doesn't contain only SI units, it contains a much more colorful
range of units (kg, dag, g, oz, ... for example) and it may cause
some confusion if too many different units are used, but if you just
write a cookery book for fun you don't think about this ... until
someone (my mother in my case) tells you that it's too confusing.

This package solves both problems: It formats your input and you have
the option to convert the units globally or locally using an easy to
use key-value system.

Please note that this package is not intended to be used to print
units (and numbers) physically correct. It should be used for more
light-hearted stuff (like a cookery book for example).
